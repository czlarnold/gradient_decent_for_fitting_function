|- functions.py  
|- gradient_decent.py  
|- training.py

File functions.py provided a template of function. The function is shown as above:
            $$f(x) = \frac{a}{b + e^{-c*x+d}}$$

File gradient_decent.py provided three gradient decent methods, which are SGD, Momentum, Adam.

File training.py provided a template of how to using.
